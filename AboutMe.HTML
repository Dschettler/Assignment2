      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>My name is Deric Schettler and I am a junior at Pittsburg State university.
           I am originally from Salina, Kansas and moved to Pittsburg for school. My hobbies include working on my old volvo 240
        and taking care of my pet reptiles. The reptiles that I currently have in my collection are a Leopard Gecko named Turbo,
        a bearded dragon named Harold, two southern toads, a corn snake named Oscar and finally a ball python named Billy.
        I have included pictures of these guys above>
